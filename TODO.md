# Short term todo of rewrite

## Needed for game

- Pops:
    - Need a building to provide knowledge/morale storage
    - Need to start with 100 morale
    - Set conversion to give -x morale if missed, else positive 1 morale
    - If moral <= 0, stop loop

- Info on edict/building pane
- Morale
- Research
- Upgrades (Cost per person/building to upgrade/change existing)

## Longer Term

- Should DerivedState logic move somewhere?
- Should we split engine from state?
- Research 1 of 3
- Regions Resources
- Random regions
- Buildings that require resources
- Base yield & conversion yield

## Ideas

- Bonus base yield (fixed and %) and same for conversion
- Infrastructure bonus for goods, and max per tech
- Morale in each region? Lose regions if conquered or rebel?
