# Summary

The heart and soul of any incremental game, or most strategy games in general, is effective use of resources. 

In Incremental Society, there are many resources that as your society progresses. 

Some resource will be generated over time, where others will have a "cap" that you can consume. It doesn's make
sense to store water for example.

Some resources will be needed ongoing to sastify your citizens, where others saved up to build, research, and expand.

New citizens will require "space" in the food\water\space caps and ongoing resourcse.
