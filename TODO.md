## Todo Now

- Instability reductions from tech
- Rework upgrade system (?)

- Archaic Age
   - Upgrades to edict outcomes from tech
   
- Stability loss causes game reset, not just "bad things"


## Later

- Show KB buttons at bottom of screen
- Gameplay pass through Archaic
- Gameplay pass through Stone Age

## Much Later

- Research 1 of 3
- Gameplay pass through Agricultural Age

## QOL

- Replace building function

## Longer Term

- Regions Resources
- Random regions
- Buildings that require resources
- Pop growth over time - For now it is just an edict
- Stability and pop growth are resources, and have a midline values. Various effects can push them up/down but will return over time

## Ideas

- Infrastructure bonus for goods, and max per tech
- Morale in each region? Lose regions if conquered or rebel?
- Card View for items
