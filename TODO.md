# Short term todo of rewrite

## Needed for game

- Pops:
    - If Instability >= 1000, stop loop

- Refresh bug on multiple nested dialogs?
- Different lengths for conversions (Set eating more frequent)
- Info on edict/building pane
- Research
- Upgrades (Cost per person/building to upgrade/change existing)

## Longer Term

- Should DerivedState logic move somewhere?
- Should we split engine from state?
- Research 1 of 3
- Regions Resources
- Random regions
- Buildings that require resources
- Base yield & conversion yield

## Ideas

- Bonus base yield (fixed and %) and same for conversion
- Infrastructure bonus for goods, and max per tech
- Morale in each region? Lose regions if conquered or rebel?
