- Remove all mutable from state items and shift into module
- Over time
   - Building build/destroy over time
   - Pop growth over time


## Longer Term

- Research
- Upgrades (Cost per person/building to upgrade/change existing)
- Research 1 of 3
- Regions Resources
- Random regions
- Buildings that require resources
- Bonus base yield (fixed and %) for conversions

## Ideas
- Infrastructure bonus for goods, and max per tech
