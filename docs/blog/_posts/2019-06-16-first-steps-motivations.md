Incremental Society is a single player civilization builder strategy game targeting the web.

I'll dig more into game play in a future post - as it is personal side project I want to spell out my personal explicit goals:

### Develop most of fun non-roguelike game with limited resources

I love roguelikes, but I've developed at least 2-3 to some level of playable and wanted to work on something else.

However, the genres that's don't require extensive graphics (2d or 3d) are few.

The explosion of incremental games on the iOS App Store suggests that it is a genre that had interest but relatively straightforward.

### Experiment with game design that favors branching paths and specializations

Many games either require:

- Decisions made up front (what class to play) before the player can make an educated choice
- Decisions are minor tweaks or bonuses that don't change how the game is played significantly

I've had thoughts on how to solve the tension between these constraints, but want to try them in practice.

### Learn a new technology stack

Every time I've worked on a side project, it has ended up with only "half-a-game" but I've walked away with significant experience in some technology stack (python, C#, iOS).

While I am not completely unfamiliar with web-tech (HTML/JS/CSS) is not a strong suit of mine.

The original plan was the write it in Rust or Typescript and target webassembly.

However, the introduction of Blazor is very exciting, and being able to leverage my C# background and target the web was too hard to pass up.
