# Crisis

Once you've expanded beyond your core, crises moments can arise which challenge the empire to overcome or suffer. Examples:

## Internal

- A succession crisis plunges the country into civil war.
- Heretical offshoots of the central church risk fracturing the unity of faith in the country.
- One or more disloyal provinces setup a counter empire and reject central control

## External

- A war from a nearby empire
- An invasion of outside barbarians
- Drought / Floods / Natural Disaster

Each one will provide some sort of choice, and then require raising a number of resources before the timer. 

Resolving it successfully within time will either provide a bonus or neglect a penalty. Failing will cause a significant penalty, such as losing a province or other growth setback.

## Philosophy

The important thing in all of these is that the enemies don't play by the same rules as the player empire. Enemy troops "pop" out of thing air, we don't simulate foriegn states, just like AI War.
