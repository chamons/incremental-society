# Gameplay Sketch

This document lays out some gameplay systems and plans to be tested out. It is a living document, and will change, but the game may diverge over time. That's ok, it's a map, nothing more.

There are three major inputs the player has into incremental-society right now, and some more planned

- Building Selection
- Edicts
- Research selection
- (Laws selection)
- (Religion selection)
- (Trade/Warfare selection)

Buildings provide constant resources over time, but are fire and forget mostly.

Edicts are almost like "clicking" in traditional incremental games, an action that you can repeat over and over to get some good.

Research allows research to be spent to unlock new buildings, edicts, and more. It is the primary progression path through the ages. 

There are current three output, with more planned

- Buildings/Regions
- Resources Totals
- Research gained
- (Laws Reformed)
- (Religion Revelations)

The core gameplay loops is get resources to make decisions to get more resources.

How to do that without:

- Make waiting for awhile being bored to get stuff
- Without making absurdly huge numbers (like most clickers)
- Have interesting decisions. 

is the hard part.

## Archaic

Your tribe having nothing more than a "roving band" with no fixed home.

The gameplay loop is very simple, hunt to provide food. Don't starve. Feast when times are good (to gain bits of knowledge).

(We need some tutorial messages here at some point).

Once you have knowledge and resources, you can start researching ideas.

Only stockpiles and timer are shown. Hide buildings, provinces, and such.

Techs:

Gathering -> Tool Making        -> Spears         -> Spear Throwers  
                                -> Stone Grinders
          -> Seasonal Gathering
          -> Early Settlements
-> Domestication of Dogs
          -> Pigments

Gathering - Expand the tribes expeditions to target plants and wild grains. Also collect some stone and wood where readily available. 
        Unlocks Gathering Action. Minor food, and trivial stone/wood
        
Tool Making - Since times immemorial what separates mankind from the animal kingdom is the consistent use of tools. Begin fashioning tools from bone, stone, and wood.
        Unlocks other tool techs
        
Seasonal Gathering - By migrating along consistent routes, resources can be exploited in season and yield increased.
        Improves overall gathering yield but increases duration
        
Stone Spears - Topped with sharpened stone projectile points, these weapons allowed hunters to go after larger prey.
        Improves hunting maximum yield
        
Spear Throwers - A wooden spear thrower allows hunters to launch spears with significantly greater force and accuracy. This allows them to hunt smaller game, which are more plentiful and consistent than megafauna.
        Improve hunting minimum and maximum yield
        
Stone Grinders - Grinding nuts, seeds, and grains extends the edible yield of gathering by allowing a wider range of items to be gathered.
        Improves gathering food yield.
        
Early Settlements - A stable food supply provides the ability to begin to settle in place. Beginning with seasonal camps over time they become more long lasting.
        Settlements lead to a new "Stone Age". Buildings and jobs can provide "passive" income and allow specialization.
        
Domestication of Dogs
        Slightly improves "Instability" decay rate.
        Slightly improves hunting yield
        
Pigments
        Improves "Instability" decay rate.


Resource list:

### Tier 0

- Food
- Wood
- Stone

### Tier 1

- Knowledge

## Stone Age

A cental camp allows producing buildings to provide passive income. There won't be enough building slots for every good, so some manual hunting/gathering/feasting is likely necessary.

First age where "upgrades" bonuses you can choose between are available. 

Techs:

Early Settlements -> Trapping          -> Food Dehydration
                  -> Organized Gathering
                  -> Storytelling      -> Burial Rights
                  -> Craftsmanship     -> Stone Axes
                                       -> Harpoons
                                       -> Basket Making
                                       -> Agriculture
                                       -> Storage Pits

Trapping
        Building "Hunting grounds" (Passive Food) and unlock archery 
        Upgrade - Skilled Hunters- Improve Hunting edict
        
Food Dehydration
         Improve food storage

Organized Gathering
        Building "Gathering Camp" (Passive Stone, Wood, some storage)
        Upgrade - Plant Lore - Improve food from gathering camp
        
Storytelling
        Building "Story Circle" (Passive knowledge)
        Upgrade - Ancient Lore - improve knowledge gain
        
Craftsmanship
        Building "Crafter's Hut" which converts Stone/Wood to Tools
        Unlock Craft Edict to convert Stone/Wood to Tools
        Upgrade - Efficient Crafting - Reduce input of tools by 1/2
        
Stone Axes
        Sharpened stone axes improve wood yield from Gathering and Gathering Camps

Burial Rights - Death confronts us all in the end. Rituals to bury the diseased with honor and respect helped comfort the tribe and form the basis for later religion.
        Improves "Instability" decay rate.
        
Harpoons - Specializes spears for hunting in rivers and lakes. Expands hunting possibilities.
        Improve hunting ground food yield
        Improve hunting edict yield

        
Basket Making
        Improve gathering building yield in all areas
        Improve gathering edict
        
Music
        Edict - Celebration. Food for instability loss
        
Agriculture
          Unlocks next age
          Building Farm - Low consistent food yield

Storage Pits
        Building "Storage Pits" - Improve Wood/Stone/Food Storage
        Edict "Deep Stone Lined Pits" - Improve Settlement/Storage Pits storage capacity

In the stone age, here is the resource list:

### Tier 0

- Food
- Wood
- Stone

### Tier 1

- Knowledge
- Tools

## Agricultural Age

Agriculture allows a consistent and stable food source year after year. This fuels expansion of settlements into large communities and incipient towns. 


### Specialization

There will be a "cluster" of technologies unlocked with each (food) specialization, and the generic charcoal/metal needed for bronze age.

Each of the first specializations will answer:

- How do I get lots more food?
- How do I get "goods", needed by bronze age citizens?
- What gameplay system do I open up in the Bronze Age (Cities, Raiding, Trade)

In other words, what is the primary way the society feeds itself?

- Agriculture focus allows significantly more food production and specialization within your territory.
    - Expanding number of slots in your territory and their power by expanding upgrade count
    - Pottery 
        - Upgrade: Pottery hut converts goods over time
        - Upgrade: Farm produces 25% more food. Food storage of settlement and huts doubles.
    - First Cities (Bronze Age)
    - "Building Tall"
- Animal Husbandry focus
    - Allows efficient travel over land, and thus more territory (2nd territory)
    - Animals (via tanning and weaving) allow efficient goods production. Below average food production.
    - Building "Wide and aggressive"
    - Unlocks "warfare", allowing raids to capture resources. (Bronze Age)
- Fishing and Sailing
    - Fishing boats provides average food production
    - Ports produce passive tools and goods production, but somewhat random (-2 something, +3 something)
    - Instead of wide or tall, build flexible but inconsistent.
    - Trade (Bronze Age)


Generic Techs

Woodworking
    - Building - Logging Camp (Wood, Tools). Produces more wood than gathering camp, but nothing else.
Stonecutting
    - Building - Quarry (Wood, Tools, Stone). Produces a lot more stone than gathering camp, but nothing else.
Charcoal
    - Charcoal Pit: Produce fuel from wood

Bronze Working 
    - moves to the bronze age. Warning: The will require consistent production of fuel, goods, and tools.

In the late stone age, here is the resource list:

### Tier 0

- Food
- Wood
- Stone

### Tier 1

- Goods
- Fuel
- Tools
- Knowledge


# FAR FUTURE

## Early Bronze Age

Transitioning to the early bronze age brings new demands upon you by your people, there is the expectation of fuel for cooking, goods, and tools.

TODO!

Research:

- Writing
- Religion
- Early Cities / Raiding / Trade
- Metal Lore
    - Upgrade: Quarry's produces small amounts of ore
