# Short term todo of rewrite

## Needed for game

- Pops:
    - Pops are provided by building structures that provide room. We grant them right away for now. 
    - Each pop provides a negative conversion that converts food and fuel to nothing, giving morale penalty otherwise
    - Each building requires a pop to run. Too many pops for capacity will give morale penalty (?)
- Morale
- Research
- Upgrades (Cost per person/building to upgrade/change existing)

## Longer Term

- Research 1 of 3
- Regions Resources
- Random regions
- Buildings that require resources
- Base yield & conversion yield

## Ideas

- Bonus base yield (fixed and %) and same for conversion
- Infrastructure bonus for goods, and max per tech
- Morale in each region? Lose regions if conquered or rebel?
