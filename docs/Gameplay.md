# Gameplay Sketch

This document lays out some gameplay systems and plans to be tested out. It is a living document, and will change, but the game may diverge over time. That's ok, it's a map, nothing more.

There are two major inputs the player has into incremental-society right now, and some more planned

- Building Selection
- Edicts
- (Research selection)
- (Laws selection)
- (Religion selection)
- (Trade/Warfare selection)

Buildings provide constant resources over time, but are fire and forget mostly.

 Edicts are almost like "clicking" in traditional incremental games, an action that you can repeat over and over to get some good.

There are current two output, with more planned

- Buildings/Regions
- Resources Totals
- (Research gained)
- (Laws Reformed)
- (Religion Revelations)

The core gameplay loops is get resources to make decisions to get more resources. 

How to do that without:

- Make waiting for awhile being bored to get stuff
- Without making absurdly huge numbers (like most clickers)
- Have interesting decisions

is the hard part.

## Early Stone Age

The game starts in the earliest part of the stone age, with your tribe having nothing more than a "roving band" with Camp you return to often.

One provence. 5 buildings?

You have some food stored, but not much, and no passive ability to get more.

(We need some tutorial messages here at some point).

You have a number of edicts you can use to order your tribe around:

- Hunt (Medium duration, gather huge amount of food)
- Feast (Long duration, convert food to knowledge)

You have to hunt to keep your tribe along, and feasting when times are good.

When you have enough knowledge, you can research the entry technology - Settlement. 

That will unlock the ability to build buildings and destroy them, to do some collection for you:

- Gathering Camp - Trivial amount of food, wood, and stone.

You will still need to hunt for food, and feast for knowledge. 

Once you have a bit of a base, though still manual, the next goal is research unlocked after settlement.

There are a few open paths:

- Storytelling (Research and Stone) - Building "Story Circle" (Passive knowledge)
- Hunting and Trapping (Research, Wood, Stone) - Unlocks hunting grounds (Collects minor version of "Hunt" edict, but not great)

- Once both of those are researched, you can research Tookmaking (Research, Stone), which promotes you to Middle Stone Age.

In the early stone age, here is the resource list:

### Tier 0

- Food
- Wood
- Stone

### Tier 1

- Knowledge

## Middle Stone Age

With a inefficient but passive base, the goal is to research new technologies, and grow your tribe.

Tools are the future, and all research and buildings will require them to some extend. The are produced by:

Crafter's Hut - Convert Stone to tools (slowly)

Research:

- Woodworking
    - Building - Logging Camp (Wood, Tools). Produces more wood than gathering camp, but nothing else.
- Stonecutting
    - Building - Quarry (Wood, Tools, Stone). Produces a lot more stone than gathering camp, but nothing else.
- Archery
    - Upgrade - Bow & Arrow - Improve Hunting production output.

Researching Agriculture transitions to the late stone age.

In the middle stone age, here is the resource list:

### Tier 0
- Food
- Wood
- Stone

### Tier 1

- Tools
- Knowledge

## Late Stone Age

TODO

There will be a "cluster" of technologies unlocked with each (food) specialization, and the generic charcoal/metal needed for bronze age.

Each specialization will answer:

- How do I get more food?
- How do I get "goods", needed by bronze age citizens?
- What gameplay system do I open up in the Bronze Age (Cities, Raiding, Trade)

The first major choice is food specialization:

- Agriculture allows significantly more food production and specialization within your territory.
    - Expanding number of slots in your territory and their power
    - Pottery allows first upgrades which increase power of slots as well.
        - Upgrade: Pottery hut converts goods over time
        - Upgrade: Farm produces 25% more food. Food storage of settlement and huts doubles.
    - Moderate goods production via Clay -> Pottery
    - First Cities (Bronze Age)
    - "Building Tall"
- Animal Husbandry
    - Allows efficient travel over land, and thus more territory (2nd territory)
    - Animals (via tanning and weaving) allow efficient goods production. Below average food production.
    - Building "Wide and aggressive"
    - Unlocks "warfare", allowing raids to capture resources. (Bronze Age)
- Fishing and Sailing
    - Fishing provides average food production
    - Ports produce passive tools and goods production, but somewhat random (-2 something, +3 something)
    - Instead of wide or tall, build flexible but inconsistent.
    - Trade (Bronze Age)


Generic Techs

- Metal Lore
    - Upgrade: Quarry's produces small amounts of ore
- Charcoal
    - Charcoal Pit: Produce fuel from wood

Research Bronze Working moves to the bronze age. Warning: The will require consistent production of fuel, goods, and tools.

In the late stone age, here is the resource list:

### Tier 0

- Food
- Wood
- Stone
- Ore

### Tier 1

- Goods
- Charcoal
- Tools
- Knowledge


FAR FUTURE

## Early Bronze Age

Transitioning to the early bronze age brings new demands upon you by your people, there is the expectation of fuel for cooking, goods, and tools.

TODO!

Research:

- Writing
- Religion
- Early Cities / Raiding / Trade
