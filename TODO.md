# Short term todo of rewrite

## Needed for game

## Longer Term

- Remove all mutable from state items and shift into module
- Research
- Upgrades (Cost per person/building to upgrade/change existing)
- Over time
   - Building build/destroy over time
   - Pop growth over time
- Research 1 of 3
- Regions Resources
- Random regions
- Buildings that require resources
- Base yield & conversion yield

## Ideas

- Bonus base yield (fixed and %) and same for conversion
- Infrastructure bonus for goods, and max per tech
- Morale in each region? Lose regions if conquered or rebel?
