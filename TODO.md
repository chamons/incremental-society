## Todo Now

- Archaic Age
   - Hide provinces, building action, population size, etc
   - Start with one province, one hidden building
   - Range of edict outcomes
   - Upgrades to edict outcomes from tech
   - List "age" somewhere in the UI

- Change building system to not be population based
- Buildings unlock job slots
- Jobs slots can be filled by pops
- Stability loss causes game reset, not just "bad things"


## Later

- Gameplay pass through middle stone age

- Research 1 of 3
- Gameplay pass through late stone age

## QOL

- Replace building function


## Longer Term

- Regions Resources
- Random regions
- Buildings that require resources
- Pop growth over time
- Stability and pop growth are resources, and have a midline values. Various effects can push them up/down but will return over time

## Ideas

- Infrastructure bonus for goods, and max per tech
- Morale in each region? Lose regions if conquered or rebel?
- Card View for items
