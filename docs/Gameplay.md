# Gameplay Sketch

This document lays out some gameplay systems and plans to be tested out. It is a living document, and will change, but the game may diverge over time. That's ok, it's a map, nothing more.

There are two major inputs the player has into incremental-society right now, and some more planned

- Building Selection
- Edicts
- Research selection
- (Laws selection)
- (Religion selection)
- (Trade/Warfare selection)

Buildings provide constant resources over time, but are fire and forget mostly.

 Edicts are almost like "clicking" in traditional incremental games, an action that you can repeat over and over to get some good.

There are current two output, with more planned

- Buildings/Regions
- Resources Totals
- Research gained
- (Laws Reformed)
- (Religion Revelations)

The core gameplay loops is get resources to make decisions to get more resources.

How to do that without:

- Make waiting for awhile being bored to get stuff
- Without making absurdly huge numbers (like most clickers)
- Have interesting decisions

is the hard part.

## Archaic

Your tribe having nothing more than a "roving band" with no fixed home.

The gameplay loop is very simple, hunt to provide food. Don't starve. Feast when times are good (to gain bits of knowledge).

(We need some tutorial messages here at some point).

Once you have knowledge and resources, you can start researching ideas.

Only stockpiles and timer are shown. Hide buildings, provinces, and such.

Techs:

Gathering -> Tool Making        -> Spears         -> Spear Throwers  
                                -> Stone Grinders
          -> Seasonal Gathering
          -> Burial Rights
          -> Early Settlements

Gathering - Expand the tribes expeditions to target plants and wild grains. Also collect some stone and wood where readily available. 
        Unlocks Gathering Action. Minor food, and trivial stone/wood
Tool Making - Since times immemorial what separates mankind from the animal kingdom is the consistent use of tools. Begin fashioning tools from bone, stone, and wood.
        Unlocks other tool techs
Seasonal Gathering - By migrating along consistent routes, resources can be exploited in season and yield increased.
        Improves overall gathering yield but increases duration
Stone Spears - Topped with sharpened stone projectile points, these weapons allowed hunters to go after larger prey.
        Improves hunting maximum yield
Spear Throwers - A wooden spear thrower allows hunters to launch spears with significantly greater force and accuracy. This allows them to hunt smaller game, which are more plentiful and consistent than megafauna.
        Improve hunting minimum and maximum yield
Stone Grinders - Grinding nuts, seeds, and grains extends the edible yield of gathering by allowing a wider range of items to be gathered.
        Improves gathering food yield.
Early Settlements - A stable food supply provides the ability to begin to settle in place. Beginning with seasonal camps over time they become more long lasting.
        Settlements lead to a new "Stone Age". Buildings and jobs can provide "passive" income and allow specialization.
Domestication of Dogs
        Slightly improves "Instability" decay rate.
        Slightly improves hunting yield
Pigments
        Improves "Instability" decay rate.


Resource list:

### Tier 0

- Food
- Wood
- Stone

### Tier 1

- Knowledge

## Stone Age

A cental camp allows producing buildings to provide passive income. There won't be enough building slots for every good, so some manual hunting/gathering/feasting is likely necessary.

Techs:

Early Settlements -> Trapping
                  -> Organized Gathering
                  -> Storytelling
                  -> Burial Rights
                  -> Craftsmanship     -> Stone Axes
                                       -> Harpoons
                                       -> Pottery
                                       -> Weaving    -> Clothing
                                                     -> Basket Making
                                       -> Agriculture
Trapping
        Building "Hunting grounds" (Passive Food)
Archery
        Upgrade - Bow & Arrow - Improve Hunting production output.


Organized Gathering
        Building "Gathering Camp" (Passive Stone, Wood)
Storytelling
        Building "Story Circle" (Passive knowledge)
Craftsmanship
        Building "Crafter's Hut" which converts Stone/Wood to Tools
Stone Axes
        Sharpened stone axes improve wood yield from Gathering and Gathering Camps
Burial Rights - Death confronts us all in the end. Rituals to bury the diseased with honor and respect helped comfort the tribe and form the basis for later religion.
        Improves "Instability" decay rate.
Harpoons
Pottery
Weaving
Clothing
Basket Making
Agriculture


## Agricultural Age

Techs:

Domestication of Livestock


In the stone age, here is the resource list:

### Tier 0

- Food
- Wood
- Stone

### Tier 1

- Knowledge
- Tools


## Late Stone Age

- Woodworking
    - Building - Logging Camp (Wood, Tools). Produces more wood than gathering camp, but nothing else.
- Stonecutting
    - Building - Quarry (Wood, Tools, Stone). Produces a lot more stone than gathering camp, but nothing else.


TODO

There will be a "cluster" of technologies unlocked with each (food) specialization, and the generic charcoal/metal needed for bronze age.

Each specialization will answer:

- How do I get more food?
- How do I get "goods", needed by bronze age citizens?
- What gameplay system do I open up in the Bronze Age (Cities, Raiding, Trade)

The first major choice is food specialization, the primary way the society feeds itself.


- Agriculture allows significantly more food production and specialization within your territory.
    - Expanding number of slots in your territory and their power
    - Pottery allows first upgrades which increase power of slots as well.
        - Upgrade: Pottery hut converts goods over time
        - Upgrade: Farm produces 25% more food. Food storage of settlement and huts doubles.
    - Moderate goods production via Clay -> Pottery
    - First Cities (Bronze Age)
    - "Building Tall"
- Animal Husbandry
    - Allows efficient travel over land, and thus more territory (2nd territory)
    - Animals (via tanning and weaving) allow efficient goods production. Below average food production.
    - Building "Wide and aggressive"
    - Unlocks "warfare", allowing raids to capture resources. (Bronze Age)
- Fishing and Sailing
    - Fishing provides average food production
    - Ports produce passive tools and goods production, but somewhat random (-2 something, +3 something)
    - Instead of wide or tall, build flexible but inconsistent.
    - Trade (Bronze Age)


Generic Techs

- Metal Lore
    - Upgrade: Quarry's produces small amounts of ore
- Charcoal
    - Charcoal Pit: Produce fuel from wood

Research Bronze Working moves to the bronze age. Warning: The will require consistent production of fuel, goods, and tools.

In the late stone age, here is the resource list:

### Tier 0

- Food
- Wood
- Stone
- Ore

### Tier 1

- Goods
- Charcoal
- Tools
- Knowledge


FAR FUTURE

## Early Bronze Age

Transitioning to the early bronze age brings new demands upon you by your people, there is the expectation of fuel for cooking, goods, and tools.

TODO!

Research:

- Writing
- Religion
- Early Cities / Raiding / Trade
