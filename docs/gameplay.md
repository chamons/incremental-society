## The initial gameplay loops

In stone age there are three tiers:

### T0 Resources
- Food
- Wood

### T1 Resources
- Clay
- Stone
- Charcoal

### T2 Resources
- Bricks
- Tools
- Knowledge

### T0 Buildings
- Gathering Camp
- Hut

### T1 Buildings
- Charcoal Pit
- Clay Pit
- Quarry is later (requires tools)

### T2 Buildings
- Crude Workshop
- Elder's Hut

### Stone Age

- Start in a small village, just barely making more resources than your current population needs (Food, Wood).
- You are making just T0 resources
- You have 2 or 3 pops, enough for one or two buildings.

- You can initially build a camp or hut, and you will likley need both before moving to T1.
- Once you have some pop you'll want to work towards a workshop to make tools

- Short term is gaining enough storage / materials to feast to gain research to get storytelling and tool making

- To make tools, we need a workshop and the tech.
- Workshop requires bricks, so clay pit comes first
- Village will be something like: Settlement, Hut, Camp, Clay Pit, Crude Workshop
- You might need at least one more camp and hut
- Afterwords you have some tools, all be it at a snails pace.

- A medium term goal is to get research to upgrade the terrible T0 buildings up the chain
- This requires specializing in food and lots of research.
- Long term goal is to get enough knowledge to research bronze age

- Super long term you want reseach (and later faith) without constant resource draining edicts, so library / shrines.
