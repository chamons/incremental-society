# Gameplay Systems

There are a number of interacting systems that make up the gameplay loops.

## General Concepts

- Your empire is made up of people, land, buildings, materials and knowledge.
- Land is made up of provinces, each providing one or more slots for buildings.
- Buildings produce jobs that people can fill, can be specialized into different versions, and made have a base yield.
- Jobs are the primary source of yield in the empire. Each job must be filled by a person.
- Yield can be directly a material or a conversion from one to another.
- Trade, faith (religion), and knowledge (research) can all specialize your society over time.
- New ages can be reached by researching sufficient technologies and spending a research cost.
- Entering new ages will increases the base requirements of people and buildings as people expect more to be happy.

## Required Yields

- In the stone age staying warm, fed, and safe is sufficient for happiness.
- However, as time passes people expect goods, services, and entertainment to stay happy.
- Buildings also may require goods to function, and may go offline if those are not available.
- Long term unhappiness may have some sort of negative impact (Civil War? Disposed?)

## Provinces

- The empire is made up by one or more provinces. 
- Each provinces will have one or more typed slots which determine what buildings can be built.
- You can build mines in mountains, logging camps in forests, and harbors on the shore.
- You can convert a province slot into a "city" which will allow urban buildings to be built for a cost. City dwellers have significantly higher expectations.
- Cities do not have base yields (no grain or wood to harvest) but can allow foreign trade, research, and administration.

## Buildings

- Buildings are based upon the province slot types.
- Plains
    - Farms
    - Villages
- Forest
    - Camps
    - Logging
- Mountain
    - Mines
    - Observatory
- Coast
    - Fishing Village
    - Harbors

## Edicts

- Togglable laws that change the rules
- Gained by culture
- A number of slots, determined by government.
- Example:
    - Agoge - Reduces population growth. Adds a Paidon√≥mos job slot which produces military power and a small amount of culture. 

## Technologies

- Split into two groups:
    - "Required" technologies which are always available
        - Can increase building\job yields
        - Can unlock buildings
        - Can increase number of slots in a province
    - Specialization techs that come up once each age and allow choice of one of a mutually exclusive optoins.
        - Example: Does your late stone age civilization adopt religion or foriegn trade or professional armies "early"
        - The non-selected options will arise in futures ages, and the selected option increased in effectiveness.

## Trade

- Most empires will be unable to produce all yields
- Early in the stone age trade will become available and extended to foriegn and overseas as the ages progress
- Should be a trickle of good for gold, and a market place of goods available for purchase.
- The amount able to be purchased \ sold should increase over time.

## Warfare

- Warfare was a constant drain of resources even in ancient times.
- Military power can be produced by training armies with men, armor, and weapons.
- Additional resources, such as horses, boats, and machines can increase their effectiveness
- Research into military specific technologies can also drastically change army performance
- Early on your neighboring provinces may send raids to be endured.
- Long term, conquering your continent is one path for growth.

## Culture and Law

- In addition to unlocking edicts, a strong culture be a source happiness and peacefully convert your neighbors.
- As the empire expands, a strong legal and administration class will be needed to rule a larger and larger area

## Religion

- Religions are found by civilizations that prioritize faith and come up multiple levels of organization:
    - Superstitions are primitive beliefs that set the tone for future developments and provide small yields
    - Pantheon extend superstitions with more concrete rule changing abilities, such as adding jobs, buildings, etc.
    - Organized Religion can be founded in later ages which extend and deepend pantheons bonuses

## Health

- Can slow or even lose population over time due to disease and malnutrition
- More urban civilizations, wars, and events can increase the severity
- Buildings, technologies, and edicts can improve over time.

## Events

- A possible addition where different short term affects occur (less crops, more disease)
    - How does this sync with a incremental game?

## Ages

- Each age determines the limit of building\technology\culture.
- Moving forward requires a massive amount of resources

## Wonders

- Super specialization buildings that you can only build a limited number (per age?)

## Resets and Challenges

- As an incremental game, resets should provide some benefit and required to reach later ages
- Challenges should also provide an incentive to show mastery of the game systems
    - Example: "Barbarian Horde" - Reach the medieval age while barbarian aggressive is massively increased
