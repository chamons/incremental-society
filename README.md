# Incremental Society

Incremental Society is a kingdom builder/simulator incremental roguelite game.

Yes, that's a lot of areas to draw from. It that might be crazy enough to work.

The core gameplay is to build a society by assigning jobs, building buildings, researching technologies, and making decisions in religion, law, and culture.

Over time your society will be challenged by both internal (unrest, civil war) and external (plague, famine, invasion) threats.
