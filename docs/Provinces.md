# Provinces

A province is a group of regions that are administratively grouped together and interact as a group.

By default, an empire starts with one "core" province that they control.

To get more, you have to colonize or conquer other regions. Once you have them you need to administer it.

## Attributes

Provinces outside of your core area of a number of attributes of interest.

- Autonomy - How much does the province follow the wishes of the capital area. Low autonomy means they follow closely and provide a majority of their resources for empire wide use. High autonomy means a majority is kept locally, and less is available. However, the local elite and population enjoys autonomy, and having it high provide a loyalty buff (and vice versa).
- Loyalty - How much does the province want to stay attached to your country and are happy with your rule. Low loyalty can risk rebellion and breaking away. Religion, laws (such as nobility), and buildings can increase loyalty, some at the cost of autonomy. Outside incursions, distance (having more provinces), and some laws (such as high taxes) can decrease.
- Infrastructure - How built up is the province with improvements and elements of civilization. Infrastructure is very slow to increase over time, and their is an age cap, but is a general increase to many areas. Infrastructure improves loyalty (as the people are less remote from the heartland) and goods production.
- Upkeep - A wideflung empire is not cheap, and resources are needed to keep the entire operation working.

## Government

More sophisticated forms of government can provide many bonuses to a wide flung empire:

- More province soft-cap (before loyalty penalities)
- Bonus Loyalty
- More infrastructure cap

## Policies

Each province can have set by the central administration to be carried out by the governor, which can provide one or more bonuses, some with a cost. Possible examples:

- Rapid Expansion - At a cost of significantly increased upkeep improve building speed, infrastructure growth rate, and provide bonus population growth.
- Royal Officials - By sending officers of the central government as administrations, reduce local autonomy further at a small loyalty cost, as people chafe over the ruling elite.
- Frontier Society - Focus on natural resource production at a cost of maximum infrastructure.
- Servants of the State - By appointing members of the upper classes at their own expense as magistrates, the cost to the central government can significantly be reduced. Reduced maximum loyality by roviding so much control to individuals.
